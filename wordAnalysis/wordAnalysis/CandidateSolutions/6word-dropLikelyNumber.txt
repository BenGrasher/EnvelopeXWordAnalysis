These candidate solutions presume that the 5th word (2nd 2 letter word) is a number.
Evidence for this:
1) The two letters used in this word are not anywhere else in the sentence.
2) The vowels are actually quite stressed with (1) as a requirement  There is not a ton of overlap between the words generally, but this is the only word where none of the letters are reused.
3) Other encodings from this same source have used numbers encoded.  (they also encoed numbers as words, so it's not like it's consistent)
4) This puzzle creator is pretty bad at puzzles, and this is something someone pretty bad at puzzles would do (break commonly held principles).  
5) The 7 word solutions don't find a solution, so something is fishy.  (a non-word inclusion, like a name, or a number)
